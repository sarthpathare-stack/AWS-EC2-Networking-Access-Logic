EC2/Cloud Learning Module Template
1️⃣ Module Title

Example: EC2 Launch Decision Simulator / Instance Sizing & Cost Evaluation

2️⃣ Learning Objective

State what this code teaches.

Example: Simulate EC2 instance launch decisions including capacity, instance sizing, AZ selection, pricing model, and cost awareness.

3️⃣ Code Overview

Short description of what the code does.

Mention:

User input / interactive options

Automated simulations (random)

Decision logic layers

4️⃣ Key Functions / Logic

List major functions and their purpose.

Example:

Function	Purpose
get_user_input()	Collects user choices for workload, instance type, region, pricing model
check_capacity()	Simulates availability in AZs
check_instance_sizing()	Checks if instance is undersized or oversized for workload
check_pricing_risks()	Flags potential pricing pitfalls
make_decision()	Combines all checks to approve/deny launch
display_results()	Prints decision, warnings, cost, AZ
5️⃣ Key Concepts Reinforced

Capacity planning (AZ availability)

Instance sizing (vCPU/RAM vs workload)

Pricing model awareness (OnDemand, Spot, Reserved, Savings Plan)

Cost evaluation (hourly/monthly estimate)

Risk awareness (Spot + stateful, high cost, oversized instances)

Decision reasoning (✅ approve vs ❌ deny + warnings)

6️⃣ Suggestions / Observations

List learning-focused improvements or notes:

Input validation

More realistic capacity simulation

Optional cost extensions (annual cost, multi-AZ)

Optional richer workload types (memory/CPU intensive)

Extensibility for more regions or instance types

7️⃣ Conclusion

Summarize what the learner gains.

Example:

Learner now understands the EC2 launch decision flow, trade-offs between cost, availability, and performance, and can reason about instance selection programmatically.

8️⃣ Important Note

This code is NOT production-grade. It is only a learning simulation to prove your understanding of EC2 networking, instance sizing, and cost management.
